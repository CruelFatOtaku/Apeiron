# Package-Specific Guidelines

## UI Package
The [packages/ui](mdc:packages/ui) package contains shared UI components:
- Components should be atomic and reusable
- Each component should have its own directory with:
  - Component file
  - Stories file for Storybook
  - Test file
  - Style file (if needed)
- Export all components through the package's index file

## Algorithms Package
The [packages/algs](mdc:packages/algs) package contains shared algorithms:
- Each algorithm should be well-documented with:
  - Time and space complexity analysis
  - Input/output specifications
  - Usage examples
- Include comprehensive test coverage
- Optimize for performance where critical

## Math Package
The [packages/math](mdc:packages/math) package contains mathematical utilities:
- Follow mathematical naming conventions
- Include detailed documentation with formulas and references
- Provide type safety for all operations
- Include unit tests with edge cases

## Configuration Packages
The configuration packages ([packages/eslint-config](mdc:packages/eslint-config) and [packages/typescript-config](mdc:packages/typescript-config)):
- Should be kept minimal and focused
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Should include documentation for any custom rules or configurations
- Should be consistent across all applications
